/**

 * @brief Compact interface for flow processing plugins (init / update / export / destroy).
 *
 * This header defines a minimal and efficient interface for flow-processing plugins.
 * Each plugin operates on a per-flow context and may observe or modify its state
 * during various stages of the flow lifecycle.
 *
 * Lifecycle (if implemented):
 *   onInit → beforeUpdate → onUpdate → onExport → onDestroy
 *
 * Each instance corresponds to one flow, with its own memory region described
 * by `PluginDataMemoryLayout`. The framework guarantees proper construction and
 * destruction via `onInit()` and `onDestroy()`.
 *
 * Inherit from `ProcessPluginCRTP<YourPlugin>` to automatically detect which
 * optional callbacks are overridden.
